## üìä Learning Path Recommendations

### **For Beginners**
1. Start with Labs 1-3 to build a solid foundation
2. Practice each concept thoroughly before moving on
3. Experiment with variations of the examples
4. Read GitLab documentation for deeper understanding

### **For Intermediate Users**

2. Use as reference for complex scenarios
3. Contribute improvements and additional examples
4. Share knowledge with your team

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**Pipeline doesn't start**
- Check `.gitlab-ci.yml` syntax using GitLab's CI Lint tool
- Verify runners are available and active
- Ensure project has CI/CD enabled

**Jobs fail with "command not found"**
- Check if the command is available in the Docker image
- Install required packages in `before_script`
- Use appropriate base images

**Artifacts not found in dependent jobs**
- Verify `dependencies:` list in job configuration
- Check artifact paths and expiration times
- Ensure source job completed successfully

**Docker build failures**
- Verify Dockerfile syntax and instructions
- Check if Docker-in-Docker service is configured
- Ensure proper registry authentication

### Getting Help

1. **Check the lab-specific README** for detailed instructions
2. **Use GitLab's CI Lint** to validate your YAML syntax
3. **Review pipeline logs** for specific error messages
4. **Consult GitLab documentation** for detailed reference
