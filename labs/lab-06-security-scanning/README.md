# 🔒 **Lab 6: Enterprise Security Scanning & Compliance** (90 minutes)

## Enhanced Learning Objectives
- Implement comprehensive security scanning (SAST, DAST, SCA, Container, IaC)
- Set up compliance reporting and governance
- Create security policy as code
- Implement automated vulnerability remediation
- Configure security monitoring and alerting

## Multi-Layer Security Approach

This lab implements enterprise-grade security practices with:

### 🛡️ **Security Scanning Types**
- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing
- **DAST**: Dynamic Application Security Testing
- **SCA**: Software Composition Analysis
- **Container Scanning**: Image vulnerability detection
- **IaC Scanning**: Infrastructure as Code security
- **Secret Detection**: Credential and API key protection

### 📜 **Policy as Code**
- Security policies in version control
- Automated policy enforcement
- Compliance validation
- Approval workflows
- Audit trails

### 📊 **Compliance & Reporting**
- SARIF format reports
- Security dashboards
- Vulnerability tracking
- Risk assessment
- Compliance metrics

## Security Tools Integration

## Getting Started

1. **Navigate to the lab:**
   ```bash
   cd labs/lab-06-security-scanning
   ```

2. **Review security policies:**
   ```bash
   cat .gitlab/security-policies/scan-execution-policy.yml
   ```

3. **Run security scans:**
   ```bash
   npm run security:all
   ```

4. **View security reports:**
   ```bash
   open security-dashboard.html
   ```

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] SAST scans complete without critical issues
- [ ] DAST scans validate application security
- [ ] Container images pass security validation
- [ ] Dependencies have no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Security policies are enforced
- [ ] Compliance reports generate correctly

## Next Steps

After implementing enterprise security, proceed to **Lab 7: Advanced Pipeline Orchestration** to build complex multi-project workflows.
