The GitLab job `validate-config` failed due to **configuration errors in the `renovate.json` file**. Here's a breakdown of what went wrong:

### ‚ùå Key Issues in the Job
- **Renovate validation failed** during the `step_script` stage.
- The error log shows:
  - `Invalid configuration option: gitlabUrl`
  - `Invalid configuration option: logLevel`

These indicate that the `renovate.json` file contains options that Renovate no longer recognizes or supports.

### üõ†Ô∏è Why This Happened
Renovate has likely updated its schema, and the options `gitlabUrl` and `logLevel` are no longer valid. Even though the config includes a `$schema` reference, Renovate still flags these as invalid, suggesting the schema may be outdated or the options deprecated.

### ‚úÖ How to Fix It
- **Remove or update** the following fields in `renovate.json`:
  - `gitlabUrl`: If you're using GitLab self-hosted, this may now be auto-detected or configured elsewhere.
  - `logLevel`: Logging configuration might now be handled via CLI flags or environment variables.
- **Validate your config** using [Renovate‚Äôs online config validator](https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema/) to ensure compatibility.
- Consider updating Renovate to the latest version and reviewing [breaking changes](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/releases) in recent releases.

If you want, I can help rewrite the `renovate.json` to match the latest schema. Just say the word.
