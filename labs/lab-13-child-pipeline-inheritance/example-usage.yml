# Example: How to use the Child Pipeline Inheritance Component in another project
# Save this as .gitlab-ci.yml in your project

# Include the child pipeline inheritance component
include:
  - component: $CI_SERVER_FQDN/$CI_PROJECT_NAMESPACE/lab-13-child-pipeline-inheritance/child-pipeline-inheritance@main
    inputs:
      stage: "maintenance"           # Stage where component jobs will run
      enable_backend_build: "true"   # Enable backend build job
      enable_validation: "true"      # Enable validation job
      docker_image: "ubuntu:22.04"   # Container image for pipeline generation

# Define your project stages (must include the stage specified in component inputs)
stages:
  - validate      # Your custom stages
  - build         # Your custom stages  
  - test          # Your custom stages
  - maintenance   # Stage where component jobs will run (matches inputs.stage)

# Your project-specific variables
variables:
  PROJECT_NAME: "my-awesome-project"
  BUILD_VERSION: "1.0.0"

# Your custom jobs (will work alongside component jobs)
custom-tests:
  stage: test
  script:
    # Use the component's standardized logging
    - eval "$ECHO_FUNCTIONS"
    - log_info "Running custom project tests"
    - log_debug "Project: $PROJECT_NAME"
    - log_debug "Version: $BUILD_VERSION"
    
    # Your test logic here
    - echo "Running unit tests..."
    - echo "Running integration tests..."
    
    - log_info "âœ… Custom tests completed"
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "push"
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"

deploy-staging:
  stage: test  
  script:
    - eval "$ECHO_FUNCTIONS"
    - log_info "ðŸš€ Deploying to staging environment"
    - log_debug "Deployment target: staging.example.com"
    
    # Your deployment logic
    - echo "Deploying application..."
    - sleep 2
    
    - log_info "âœ… Staging deployment completed"
  environment:
    name: staging
    url: https://staging.example.com
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "develop"
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
      when: manual

# The component will automatically add these jobs to your pipeline:
# 1. component-validate-syntax (stage: validate)
# 2. component-backend-build (stage: build) - if backend changes detected
# 3. component-generate-child-pipeline (stage: maintenance)  
# 4. component-trigger-dynamic-child (stage: maintenance)

# The generated child pipeline will include dynamic jobs based on your project structure:
# - dynamic-build-frontend (if frontend/ or *.js files detected)
# - dynamic-build-backend (if backend/ or *.py files detected)  
# - dynamic-build-infrastructure (if Dockerfile or kubernetes/ detected)
# - dynamic-deploy-production (if main branch, manual trigger)
